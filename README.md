# Port of Long Beach: Sustainability Analysis with Cesium & ArcGIS Pro 3.2

## Welcome

This repository contains the Port of Long Beach Sustainability Analysis project, which utilizes Cesium and ArcGIS Pro 3.2 alongside web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to visualize and analyze sustainability challenges and mitigation efforts for cleaner port operations.

## Background

Inspired by my studies at the USC Price School of Public Policy and the USC Spatial Sciences Institute, this project is a deep dive into the sustainability initiatives of The Port of Long Beach. It combines urban planning insights with geospatial intelligence to shed light on the environmental impact of port operations and their sustainable transformation.

## Technical Learning

This project has been a tremendous learning journey, introducing me to the robust Cesium Community, the intricacies of managing GitHub repositories, and the utility (and occasional pitfalls) of leveraging AI tools like ChatGPT 4.

### Key Takeaways

- **ChatGPT 4**: While helpful, it should not be the sole source of troubleshooting. It's best used as a guide alongside your coding skills.
- **JavaScript for Beginners**: The Microsoft Developer YouTube series is an excellent resource for new developers.
- **Node.js and npm**: Essential tools for JavaScript development. Ensure Node.js is installed to use npm effectively.
- **Debugging**: Familiarize yourself with browser tools such as cache clearing (Control+F5) and developer consoles (Control+F12 on Windows) for efficient debugging.

## Common Pitfalls

A recurring issue during development was losing the Cesium frame due to syntax errors such as unexpected braces. Always double-check your code, and don't hesitate to seek assistance from automated tools or community forums.

## Acknowledgements

I extend my gratitude to Cesium for their Microgrant Opportunity and the Cesium Community for their support as well at the USC Spatial Sciences Institute and Professor Dr. Jennifer Swift for being my project sponosor for its presentation at the LA Geospatial Summit (Febraury 2024).
